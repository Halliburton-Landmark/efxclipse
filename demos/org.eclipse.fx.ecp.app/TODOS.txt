API:

- Prefixes: What's the rule behind the prefixes (ME, ECP, I, ...)?
- Variable names sometimes don't match the type name / getters and setters
- No clear separation between EMFStore and ECP
- Interface documentation is very poor
- An architecture chart would be nice
- SWT dependencies all over the place


Step 1:

- create architectural overview
- create JavaFX e4 application with basic parts (Repository Explorer, Project Explorer, Model Element Editor, Validation View) 
- create a model workspace mockup 
- create basic unit test
- create build config
- add some basic javadoc
- update website
 
Step 2:

- add more dialogs / wizards
- add Jemmy tests
- add proper documentation

ECP Questions:

InternalChildreList contains a reference to its parent. Yet the parent needs to be passed to Provider.fillChildren(). Why?

TODO (by parts):

Model Explorer:
 - Add / Remove Model Element
 - Open Model Element (double click)
 - Add / Delete Project
 - Update / Commit

Model Editor
 - Reference Control
 - Reference Selection Dialog

Repository Browser:
 - Add Dialogs
 - Checkout
